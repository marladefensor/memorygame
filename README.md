## Instructions

Try to match all the cards up with their matching pair! Click on a card to flip it over. If the second card you select is the same as your first card, they will match up! If the cards don't match up, both will flip over and you will have to try match up another pair. When you complete the game, a modal displays a star rating that rates your game, and how long it took you to complete the game.
